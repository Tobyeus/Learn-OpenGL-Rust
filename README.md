# Learn-OpenGL-Rust
This repository will show my progress learning OpenGL in Rust

I will be following the famous tutorial [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) by Joey de Vries. Since I started learning Rust, I thought it might a great idea to follow the tutorial using Rust. As a starting and reference point, I will be using the [Rust port](https://github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs) of LearnOpenGL by bwasty.

# Structure

As of now, I will mainly code in the main.rs file of the src folder. Finished chapters will be converted into examples, which can be run separately.

# How to use the examples

Make sure to use ```cargo build``` before running anything. The examples can be run via the command ```cargo run --example <example_name>```.

## List of the available examples:

1. Getting started:
- hello_triangle
- hello_indexed

The List will grow gradually over time.
