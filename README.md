# Learn-OpenGL-Rust
This repository will show my progress learning OpenGL in Rust

I will be following the famous tutorial [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) by Joey de Vries. Since I started learning Rust, I thought it might a great idea to follow the tutorial using Rust. As a starting and reference point, I will be using the [Rust port](https://github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs) of LearnOpenGL by bwasty.
